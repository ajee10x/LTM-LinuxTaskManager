LTM (Linux Task Manager) is an open-source project that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and managing various aspects of a Linux system. It offers a convenient way to view and control processes, monitor system performance, manage startup applications, access user information, and handle services.

## Key Features

- Process Management: View and manage running processes, terminate or prioritize processes
- System Performance Monitoring: Real-time CPU, memory, disk, and network usage metrics.
- Application History: Track launched applications and their execution history.
- Startup Applications: Only Display the applications to launch at system startup.
- User Management: Monitor active users, login times, and associated processes.
- Service Control: Display the system services in real time.

## Key Features are still under development 
- Update Checking: Check for updates and download the latest version of the application.
- Service Control: Start, stop, and restart system services.
- Startup Applications: Configure applications to launch at system startup.
- System Performance Monitoring: Make it more advance.
- About us: Make it more professional.
- Fix the refresh problem by making the refresh from the Main.java to all the files by removing the refresh by each file on itself.
